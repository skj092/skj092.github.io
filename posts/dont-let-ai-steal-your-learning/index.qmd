Short-term shortcut widen the knowledge gap. Long-term growth comes from doing the work.

## Why Implement Papers Yourself?

Recently, a friend suggested:
*"Why don't you use this new tool to implement research papers?"*

That made me pause and think.
Why do we even bother implementing papers ourselves?

## The Purpose of Implementation

When I implement a paper, my goal is usually one of two things:

1. **To test an idea under different conditions**
2. **To deeply understand what the main contribution really is**

For both of these, relying on AI to do the heavy lifting doesn’t help much.

## Discovery Through Process

Most of the time, we don’t know *exactly* what we want at the start — and that’s normal.
By working through the process ourselves, we **discover what actually matters**.

If AI does all the work for us:
- We risk building something irrelevant.
- Each iteration makes the system more complex, but since we didn’t lay the foundation, we can’t really understand or improve it.
- At some point, we get lost.

## Knowledge Compounds

Knowledge compounds.
The time you spend understanding an idea is never wasted — it **accumulates** and **pays off later**.

If you skip that learning, you’ll keep restarting from the same point, stuck in a loop.
That may work for short-term business goals, but it isn’t good for your own growth.

## Beyond Reproduction

Implementing papers isn’t just about reproducing results.
It’s about **reproducing understanding**.

If we outsource that part, we’re not saving time.
We’re skipping growth.
